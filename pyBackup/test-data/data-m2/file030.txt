shutil.copy(src, dst)
    Copy the file src to the file or directory dst. If dst is a directory, a file with the same basename as src is created (or overwritten) in the directory specified. Permission bits are copied. src and dst are path names given as strings.

shutil.copy2(src, dst)
    Similar to shutil.copy(), but metadata is copied as well â€“ in fact, this is just shutil.copy() followed by copystat(). This is similar to the Unix command cp -p.
